C# .Net 6

##Instructions

In the appsettings file, you will need to add a path to the path variable of where the files are located. I'm assuming the file names are "metadata" and "stats", so these values have already been assigned to a variable inside the FileRepository class.

##Additional Libraries used
- MediatR
- JetBrains Annotations
- Microsoft Extensions Options
